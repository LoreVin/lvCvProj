This is a very useful OpenCV - based architecture library. 
This library can help developers quickly develop their own visual algorithm applications. 
In an object-oriented form, this library encapsulates classes including morphological operations, histograms, look-up tables, image processing, video processing, and image sequence processing.
Programmers can rapidly develop their own visual applications based on this architecture library.
Moreover, they can flexibly expand this library (because this library is designed using design patterns such as the factory pattern).
Hope this helps everyone! Thank you!
